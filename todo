Styling:
  Submit claims page:
x   Add a header ("Starred fields are required") and fix spacing
x   General css changes
x   Embed form in a table
x   Use a slider for initial bet
x     Restrict slider to allowed range
      Show the amount risked as a function of the initial prob.
x   Use datetimepicker instead of two fields for date and time
x   Remove multiplier, max bet fields
x Claims details page:
x   Change bet grid to outcomes table:
x     Title: "Outcomes"
x     Check and X for True or False
x     "Before this bet", "After this bet"
x   Show domain under claim, not sidebar
x   Move confirm/deny to center of page
x     Change to Mark True Check, Mark False X
x   Restrict slider to allowed range
      (Show bounds on the slider)
x General:
x   Floating sidebar and topbar
x   Show points free instead of committed
x   Nice modal for signup - name, email, pwd, retype pwd
x   Nice modal for resolve bet

Tags:
x Change "domains" to "tags" everywhere
x Allow tag input to take uppercase characters - lower on server
x Multiple tags per bet
x Create widget for selecting a subet of tags:
x   Use tagit multi-tag text box
x   On submit claims page, add options for creating new tags
    Use widget on submit claim + manage tags page
x Add "search by tag" bar to main page
x   (Incremental search)
x   (Full text search)

Groups and privacy controls:
x For each group you are a part of, add row on account settings:
x   Header: group name
x   Table mapping user -> email and status (invite sent, accepted)
x   If owner, two-four buttons on the right:
x     Add user:
x       Sends email
x       Email acceptance associates userid with email
x     Kick user - when users are selected
      (Promote - if admin)
      (Delete)
x   If member, Leave button on the right
x Search semantics:
x   Users only see claims they have access to ANY private group for

Remaining UI issues:
  Account settings page:
    Allow users to see / modify their email
    Bring back the "default search" functionality
  High scores page
  Groups:
    Let users delete groups
    Include a list of users in the invites dropdown

Backend/scaling and other issues:
x Don't take bounty or maxstake from the client
x Store pwd hashes at the server
x   Salt hashes w/ salt stored outside repo
  Pagination on main page
  Fixed-size LRU cache for searches / claims
  Use JSON for transport from the server to the client
x Escape unconstrained content (descriptions and definitions)
